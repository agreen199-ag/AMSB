            The Application Status column can be one of three values: Enrolled, Applied, or Completed. Candidates should start off as Enrolled. This should be changed to
            Applied if the candidate applies, and finally to Completed if the candidate completes their application.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Onboarding Status column can be blank, or one of three values: Interviewed, Job Offered, or Onboarded. Candidates should start off with no Onboarding status.
            This should be changed to Interviewed if the candidate receives an interview, to Job Offered if the candidate receives a job offer, and finally to Onboarded if
            the candidate is hired.
