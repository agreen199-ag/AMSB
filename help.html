                <h4>Section 2 - Candidate Table</h4>
                <p>This report contains a detailed list of AMSB candidates.</p>
                <p>The table itself is on the right. Each row represents a candidate, and each column holds various data for that candidate.
                    To see all of the data columns, use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the table.</p>
                <p>To filter the table by site, role, application status, or onboarding status, use the check boxes on the left.</p>
                <p>To filter the table by last or first name, type the name to search for in the text boxes on the left and press enter.</p>
                <p>To filter the table by application date, days until separation date, or days until start date, use the sliders on the left.
                    You can either change the lower and upper bounds by typing them in the number box and pressing enter, or by dragging the circles
                    on the slider.</p>
                <p>The map at the bottom displays candidate locations. Clicking on a candidate in the table will show their location in the map,
                    and clicking on a dot in the map will show all candidates in that location.
